## Features

- **Dark Pattern Detection**: Deceptify analyzes website elements and detects patterns commonly associated with deceptive user interface design.
- **Real-time Feedback**: Receive real-time feedback while browsing websites, alerting you to potential dark patterns.
- **Customizable Settings**: Tailor Deceptify's detection sensitivity and feedback preferences to suit your browsing experience.
